    "In statistics and probability theory, data distributions and density functions play a fundamental role in describing and analyzing data. Here, I'll explain different types of data distributions and their corresponding types of density functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Data Distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution):**\n",
    "   - The normal distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped.\n",
    "   - It's characterized by two parameters: mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ).\n",
    "   - Probability Density Function (PDF): \n",
    "     - The PDF of the normal distribution is given by the formula:\n",
    "     ![Normal Distribution PDF](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f(x)&space;=&space;\\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Uniform Distribution:**\n",
    "   - The uniform distribution has constant probability across its entire range.\n",
    "   - It's often used when all outcomes are equally likely.\n",
    "   - PDF: \n",
    "     - For a continuous uniform distribution, the PDF is a constant value within a specified interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exponential Distribution:**\n",
    "   - The exponential distribution describes the time between events in a Poisson process (e.g., waiting times).\n",
    "   - It's characterized by the rate parameter (λ).\n",
    "   - PDF: \n",
    "     - The PDF of the exponential distribution is given by the formula:\n",
    "     ![Exponential Distribution PDF](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f(x)&space;=&space;\\lambda&space;e^{-\\lambda&space;x},&space;\\text{for}&space;x&space;\\geq&space;0)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Poisson Distribution:**\n",
    "   - The Poisson distribution models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.\n",
    "   - It's characterized by the rate parameter (λ).\n",
    "   - Probability Mass Function (PMF): \n",
    "     - The PMF of the Poisson distribution is given by the formula:\n",
    "     ![Poisson Distribution PMF](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(X=k)&space;=&space;\\frac{e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^k}{k!},&space;\\text{for}&space;k&space;\\geq&space;0)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Binomial Distribution:**\n",
    "   - The binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.\n",
    "   - It's characterized by two parameters: the number of trials (n) and the probability of success (p).\n",
    "   - PMF: \n",
    "     - The PMF of the binomial distribution is given by the formula:\n",
    "     ![Binomial Distribution PMF](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(X=k)&space;=&space;C(n,k)&space;\\cdot&space;p^k&space;\\cdot&space;(1-p)^{n-k},&space;\\text{for}&space;k&space;=&space;0,&space;1,&space;2,&space;\\ldots,&space;n)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Density Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Probability Density Function (PDF):**\n",
    "   - PDF describes the probability distribution of a continuous random variable.\n",
    "   - It's used for continuous data.\n",
    "   - It integrates over the entire range to equal 1.\n",
    "   - Example: Normal distribution PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Probability Mass Function (PMF):**\n",
    "   - PMF describes the probability distribution of a discrete random variable.\n",
    "   - It's used for discrete data.\n",
    "   - It sums up to equal 1 over all possible values.\n",
    "   - Example: Poisson distribution PMF.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):**\n",
    "   - CDF gives the probability that a random variable takes a value less than or equal to a specific value.\n",
    "   - It's used for both continuous and discrete data.\n",
    "   - Example: The integral of the PDF for continuous distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Survival Function (SF):**\n",
    "   - SF gives the probability that a random variable takes a value greater than a specific value.\n",
    "   - It's used for both continuous and discrete data.\n",
    "   - Complementary to the CDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some of the fundamental data distributions and density functions used in statistics and probability theory to model and analyze various types of data. The choice of distribution depends on the nature of the data and the specific problem being addressed.\n"
