    "# Non-Probability Sampling Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "## Convenience Sampling\n",
    "Convenience sampling is a non-probability sampling technique where samples are selected from the population only because they are conveniently available to the researcher. Researchers choose these samples just because they are easy to recruit, and the researcher did not consider selecting a sample that represents the entire population. Convenience sampling is commonly used for its speed, cost-effectiveness, and ease of availability of the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Consecutive Sampling\n",
    "Consecutive sampling is similar to convenience sampling, with a slight variation. Here, the researcher picks a single person or a group of a sample, conducts research over a period, analyzes the results, and then moves on to another subject or group if needed. Consecutive sampling allows the researcher to work with many topics and fine-tune their research by collecting results with vital insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quota Sampling\n",
    "Quota sampling is used when researchers are interested in specific strata or groups within a population. It involves dividing the population into strata and selecting samples from each stratum to create a representative sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Judgmental or Purposive Sampling\n",
    "Judgmental or purposive sampling relies on the researcher's knowledge and credibility. Researchers select samples based on their judgment of who is fit to participate in the research study. However, this method is not scientific and can introduce bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Snowball Sampling\n",
    "Snowball sampling is used when the sample size is small and not easily available. Researchers use this technique when subjects are difficult to locate. It works like a referral program, where initial subjects help find similar subjects to form a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use Non-Probability Sampling?\n",
    "- To indicate if a particular trait or characteristic exists in a population.\n",
    "- In qualitative research, pilot studies, or exploratory research.\n",
    "- When there are time constraints or budget limitations.\n",
    "- When in-depth analysis of a particular issue is needed.\n",
    "- When results are not intended to generalize to the entire population.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Advantages of Non-Probability Sampling\n",
    "- Practical and conducive for real-world surveys.\n",
    "- Faster and cost-effective in obtaining responses.\n",
    "- Can produce quality results when done correctly.\n",
